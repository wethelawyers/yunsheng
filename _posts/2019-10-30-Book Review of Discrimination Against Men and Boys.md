Contrary to the common perception that only women and girls are discriminated on the basis of sex, discrimination against men and boys can also happen, and in some cases, it can be even more evident. This is the main argument of David Benatar in his new book, *The Second Sexism*. By the term ‘second sexism’ Benatar means the wrongful discrimination against men and boys on the basis of sex, which he claims is ‘[s]o unrecognized […] that the mere mention of it will appear laughable to some’ (p.2). The primary purpose of this book is to make this type of sexism visible and to present second sexism as a new addition to the concerns of policy makers, human rights activists and feminists. 

> 与大众认知中只有女人和女孩会基于其性别而遭受歧视相反，针对男人和男孩的性别歧视也在发生，并且在一些案例中这种情形更为明显。这是David Benatar新书《第二性别歧视》的主要论点。“第二性别歧视”一词，即Benatar所称的“如此的不被认可以至于仅仅是提及它都会令某些人觉得可笑”（原书第2页）的针对男人和男孩的错误歧视。这本书的首要目的是揭示这类型的性别歧视，并将第二性别歧视作为一项新内容呈现在政策制定者、人权活动家以及女权主义者面前。

Benatar acknowledges that the sexism against women and girls (which he calls *first sexism*) is still a more severe problem in most parts of the world. However, he argues that, contrary to popular belief, men and boys can also be subject to discrimination. For example, he discusses state policies and/or social norms that primarily encourage men, but rarely women, into military conscription and combat, causing millions of men to die or suffer physically and psychologically. In those few countries where women are conscripted, such as Israel, women are treated much more leniently. According to him, men are also victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, but state institutions and society in general take such violence less seriously because of the prevailing attitudes towards men, such as the belief that men are fearless, sustain greater pain, and are more capable of self-defence. He cites a study which showed that ‘clinical psychologists were more likely to hypothesise sexual assault in females than males’ (p.37). He also quotes some studies which show that females are likely to be treated more leniently than males when being sentenced by the court system, and when the victim is female, the offender is more likely to be arrested. However, one may argue that reducing the causes for these differences only to sex of the victim/offender is misleading, because many other variables such as age, colour, ethnicity, history of prior offenses, and the severity of the crime also influence arrest and sentence system. Benatar argues that sexual assault is underreported in case of both sexes; but the reporting rate is even lower when the victim is male, and if reported, people are less sympathetic to male victims. A study on sexual harassment in the US prison system found that ‘the sexual coercion incidence rate for males was 22%, while for females it was 7%’ (p.39). However, one may object that often men themselves are perpetrators of sexual assault on males, not females.

> Benatar承认针对女人和女孩的性别歧视（他称之为“第一性别歧视”）在世界大范围内仍然是严峻的问题。然而他也认为，不同于普遍看法，男人和男孩也会成为被歧视的对象。例如，他讨论了主要鼓励男人而几乎不鼓励女人服兵役和参加战斗的国家政策和/或社会规范导致数以百万计的男人死亡或遭受身心痛苦。在那些少数的招募妇女入伍的国家，例如以色列，对妇女的对待则要宽容得多。作者认为，男人同样也是家庭暴力和性侵犯的受害者，但由于加诸男人的普遍看法——例如坚信男人更加无所畏惧、男人可以承受更大的痛苦以及男人具有更强的自卫能力等——国家机构和社会大体上对这种情况并不重视。他援引了一项研究，该研究表明“临床心理学家更倾向于假设女性而非男性遭受了性侵犯”（原书第37页）。作者还引用了其他一些研究。这些研究表明，在接受司法审判时，女性可能比男性受到更为宽容的待遇；当受害者是女性时，罪犯更有可能被逮捕。但可能有人会争辩说，将这些差异的原因仅归因于受害者/罪犯的性别是一种误导，因为还存在许多诸如年龄、肤色、种族、前科以及犯罪严重程度等的其他变量，也会影响逮捕和刑罚。 Benatar称，两种性别中的性侵犯都没有被完整报道，但受害者为男性的报道率甚至更低，且即使这种案例被报道，人们对男性受害者的同情程度也会更低。对美国监狱系统中的一项性骚扰研究则发现，“对男性的性胁迫发生率为22％，而对女性的性胁迫发生率为7％”（原书第39页）。但有人可能会反对说，男性而非女性本身通常就是对男性进行性侵犯的肇事者。

Benatar notes that in developed countries of the west, boys also face increasing educational disadvantages: they drop out of schools at higher rates than girls, and are less likely to be educated to degree level. This leads Benatar to argue that ‘[i]f the sexes in these statistics were reversed, feminists would take this to be evidence of overall female disadvantage’ (p.49). Other examples of second sexism the author discusses include male disadvantage in terms of child custody in divorce cases, paternity leave, and the shorter life expectancy of men as compared to women. 

> Benatar指出，在西方发达国家，男孩在教育方面也面临着越来越严重的不利条件：他们辍学率要高于女孩，而且受教育的程度也较低。Benatar就此争辩说：“如果这些统计数据中的性别颠倒过来，女权主义者会将其视为女性整体处于不利地位的证据”。作者讨论第二种性别歧视的其他例子还包括在离婚子女抚养权、陪产假以及更短的预期寿命方面，男性均处于不利地位。

But do these various disadvantages amount to sexism against men and boys? Though the author should be credited for bringing into the limelight some disadvantages of being a male, to call these disadvantages second sexism would imply that women are responsible for discrimination against men, which is often not the case. It is an accepted academic stand that sexism is *systematic* and *structural*, and that it involves the subordination of one group as a whole by another group which enjoys power and advantage in the system. Sexism occurs in the context of a specific set of institutional arrangements and a specific ideology which creates and maintains a system in which political, economic and social power is concentrated in the hands of males (Wasserstrom 1997). Similarly, the well-known feminist theorist Marilyn Frye believes that ‘the locus of sexism is primarily in the system and framework, not in the particular act’ (1983, p.19). Furthermore, it is also true that men themselves seem to be responsible for discrimination against men in most of the examples cited by Benatar. Benatar has pre-emptively tried to answer these objections by saying that (1) discrimination need not reach the systematic level in order for it to constitute sexism, and (2) neither all men are in power nor does it really matter who the perpetrators are. However, one may ask Benatar: who is responsible for second sexism – the system or individuals? Benatar seems to have no clear answer. He diffuses the responsibility for the second sexism inconsistently across these two sources. Benatar never fully answers the charge that it is the patriarchal system itself which places extra responsibilities on the male, and it may be the price that some men are paying for their overall advantageous position in society. Owing to the controversial nature of the topic, the author has yet to answer a number of counterarguments. However, one must agree with him that the overall greater severity of the first sexism does not imply that the second sexism should be denied, ignored or tolerated. 

> 但是，上述种种不利是否就等于对男人和男孩的性别歧视？ 尽管我们应当把这些作为男人所承受的不利情形置于聚光灯下归功于作者，但将这些不利情形称之为“第二性别歧视”会意味着女性在针对男性的歧视中是负有责任的，可事实并非如此。公认的学术立场是，性别歧视是<u>系统性</u>和<u>结构性</u>的，并且涉及一个群体作为一个整体在另一个于制度中享有权力和优势的群体中所处的从属地位。性别歧视是在一系列特定的制度安排和意识形态背景下发生的，上述制度安排及意识形态创造并维护了一种政治、经济和社会权力集中在男性手中的制度（Wasserstrom 1997）。相类似的，著名女权主义理论家Marilyn Frye也认为性别歧视的根源主要在于制度和框架，而不是特定行为（1983, p.19）。此外，在Benatar引用的大多数例子中，男性本身似乎也应为针对男性的歧视负责。Benatar先发制人地试图回答这些反对意见。他说道：（1）歧视不需要达到制度层面才构成性别歧视，而且（2）不是所有男性都拥有权力，肇事者是谁也没有关系。但是人们可能会问Benatar，谁应当为第二性别歧视负责？是制度还是个人？Benatar似乎没有明确的答案。他在对制度和个人这两者之间的不一致扩大了第二性别歧视的责任。Benatar亦从未完全回应父权制本身给男性带来了更多责任这一指责，也许这就是男性为他们在社会上整体的优势地位所付出的代价。鉴于该主题本身的争议性，作者尚未对许多反对意见作出回应。但必须同意他的是，第一性别歧视的总体严重性并不意味着应该拒绝、忽视或容忍第二性别歧视。

The main strength of the book lies in being the first systematic attempt to point out the so far neglected aspects of discrimination against men and boys in its different forms. From its title the book may look to be part of a backlash against feminism, but it could function as both a complement and a supplement to feminist objectives. There is certainly much in the book that feminists would find to their benefit. For example, the author rejects biological determinism and social conservatism which has been the target of feminist writings since its beginning. In fact, Benatar calls for an alliance between feminists and men’s rights activists to work together to combat all forms of sexism (first and second) against all types of victims. Like Beauvoir’s book *The Second Sex*, Benatar’s *Second Sexism* has the potential of becoming a classic in gender studies. Though students of social sciences, particularly of sociology, anthropology and gender studies, are not obliged to agree with the arguments presented by the author; they are certainly encouraged to read the book.

> 本书的主要优势在于，它首次系统性的尝试指出目前对于各种形式的针对男人和男孩的性别歧视的忽视。从书名来看，这本书可能是反对女权主义的一部分，但它亦可能是对于女权主义目标的完整和补充。女权主义者肯定会在本书中找到很多有益的东西。例如，作者拒绝了生物决定论和社会保守主义——这些从一开始就是女权主义著作的靶子。实际上，Benatar呼吁女权主义者和男性权利活动家结成联盟，共同努力以应对各种形式的、针对各类受害人的性别歧视（包括第一和第二性别歧视）。像波伏娃的著作《第二性》一样，Benatar的《第二性别歧视》也有可能成为性别研究领域的经典著作。尽管社会科学领域的学生，特别是从事社会学、人类学和性别研究的学生没有义务同意作者所呈现的观点，但他们也应当被鼓励阅读此书。
